# GCSC
Welcome! GCSC regression performs gene set enrichment analysis using gene expression data through the TWAS framework. It is described in our preprint [Leveraging gene co-regulation to identify gene sets enriched for disease heritability](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.22.453442v1). For instructions, see the [GCSC wiki](https://github.com/ksiewert/GCSC/wiki).
